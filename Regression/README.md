# Simple Linear Regression
This model uses a single input to inferan outcome value based on a given value. For example, using the weight alone to determine the MPG of a car.
# Multiple Linear Regression
This model uses multiple inputs to infer an outcome value based on several given values. For example, use all of the physical features to determine the MPG of a car. Much more robust than single linear regression, but aside from considering more features is very similar mathematically.
# Polynomial Linear Regression
This model can use a single or multiple inputs to determine a likely result based on one or multiple values. In my experience this model tends to be pretty accurate when it is an n-degree model, where n is equal to the number of features. If the number of features is greater than 6, then you're probably safest sticking with a 6-degree polynomial to ensure it'll finish.
