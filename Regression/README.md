# Simple Linear Regression
    This model uses a single input to infer the likelihood of the outcome occuring based on a given value. For example, using the weight alone to determine the MPG of a car.
# Multiple Linear Regression
    This model uses multiple inputs to infer the likelihood of the outcome occurring based on several given values. For example, use all of the physical features to determine the MPG of a car. Much more robust than single linear regression, but aside from considering more features is very similar mathematically.
# Polynomial Linear Regression
