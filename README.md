# MachineLearningModels
Machine Learning Models I have created. Both with the help with the class credited at the bottom, and on my own. The models in the specific folders tend to be skeletons mostly inspired by the course. However, the solutions are my attempts at finding the best model for a given problem. 

# Data
Contains all the datasets used for these models.

# Classification
Contains the following classification models:
- Logistic Regression Classification
- K-Nearest Neighbors Classification
- Support Vector Machine Classification
- Kernel Support Vector Machine Classification
- Naive Bayes Classification
- Decision Tree Classification
- Random Forest Classification

# Classification Solutions
Solutions utilizing Classification models.

# Clustering
Contains the following clustering models:
- K-Nearest Neighbors Clustering

# Regression
Contains the following regression models:
- Simple Linear Regression (Single input to determine single output)
- Multiple Linear Regression (Multiple inputs to determine single output)
- Polynomial Linear Regression (Single or multiple inputs to determine a single output)
- Support Vector Regression (Single or Multiple inputs to determine a single output)
- Decision Tree Regression (Multiple inputs to determine a single output)
- Random Forest Regression (Multiple inputs to determine a single output)

# Regression Solutions
Contains all of my solutions that implemented a regression algorithm
